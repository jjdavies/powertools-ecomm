PowerTools e-commerce website.
This application was built with NextJS to demonstrate fast content delivery with SSR (Server-side rendering).
The data is delivered by PostgreSQL servers and pre-rendered to ensure fast delivery while maintaining the ability to update products, by re-rendering.
Client components are used for client state. Local storage is used for guest shopping carts.
Stripe used for checkout. Guest users are sent an email after paying, and the fulfilment is handled by checking orders through Stripe dashboard.

Potential further actions: 1. Store orders in a database to fulfil quicker and more efficiently. Also handle inventory, track product and ordering trends, other business logic. 2. Create customer accounts to provide more control and features to customers and business.
